To be able to run 3dm from the shell scripts, put the following jars
in this directory:

xerces.jar
sax2.jar
java-getopt-1.0.8.jar

Visit the 3dm home page for links to the files.

(They are currently not included in the project, because I have not had time to check
the licensing issues for these files)
