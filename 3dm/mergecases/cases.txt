Merge cases: Purpose?

- to demonstrate desired merging behaviour in various cases
  (=> exact definition of reasonable merging behaviour??)
- to test the merge tool against

These are the merge cases
(Mxx) is the case depicted
[Mxx] is a similar case

Insertion
=========

i1 Simple insertion i different subtrees (M18) [M14] 
i2 Same subtree, end of list / same pos; can be seen as conflict (M19)
i3 Several inserts in same subtree; can be seen as conflict (M16)

Deletion
========

d1 Simple deletion in different subtrees (M13)
d2 Deletion of same node (M21)
d3 Several deletions in same subtree (M20)

Conflicts cannot occur with deletions only.

Updates
=======

Quite trivial, no paper cases

u1 Update of differnt nodes
u2 Update of same node, updates identical (possibly conflict all the same?)
u3 CONFLICT: Same node, different updates  

Moves
=====

m1 Moves in different childlist (renders uglily) (M24)
m2 Moves in same childlist (M4)
m3 Moves at different levels of same subtree (M5)
m4 Move conflict RENDERING BUGS! (M22)
m5 Move with shifting (M25)

Copies
======

c1 Copies into different childlists RENDER PROBS
c2 Copies to same childlist (M28)
c3 Copy with shifting (M26)
c4 CONFLICT: Differnt node to same dest (M27)

Combinations
============

INS DEL UPC MOV CPY 

Conflicts
