Merge cases: Purpose?

- to demonstrate desired merging behaviour in various cases
  (=> exact definition of reasonable merging behaviour??)
- to test the merge tool against

These are the merge cases
(Mxx) is the case depicted
[Mxx] is a similar case

Insertion
=========

i1 Simple insertion i different subtrees (M18) [M14] 
i2 Same subtree, end of list / same pos; can be seen as conflict (M19)
i3 Several inserts in same subtree; can be seen as conflict (M16)

Deletion
========

d1 Simple deletion in different subtrees (M13)
d2 Deletion of same node (M21)
d3 Several deletions in same subtree (M20)

Conflicts cannot occur with deletions only.

Updates
=======

Quite trivial, no paper cases

u1 Update of differnt nodes
u2 Update of same node, updates identical (possibly conflict all the same?)
u3 CONFLICT: Same node, different updates
